# ansi2html

A C program that converts (most) ANSI color escape (16, 256, and 24-bit) foreground and background color, and "style" codes to HTML.

## How to install

There are two binary versions on the [releases page](https://github.com/mfontani/ansi2html/releases):
- `ansi2html`, which contains all base palettes _and_ palettes imported from [the iTerm2-Color-Schemes repo](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/Xresources) (with an `i2_` prefix)
- `ansi2html-noi2`, which contains only the base palettes, and is smaller (if you know all colors in the palette, can use the `--rgb-for` option multiple times, to customize the foreground, background and all base 16 colors)

You can download a pre-packaged binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/mfontani/ansi2html/releases),
where binaries for both Linux, Windows, and MacOS x86_64 and arm64 are available,
or use a tool such as [ubi](https://github.com/houseabsolute/ubi) to fetch it
and install it to your local `$HOME/bin` (assuming it's in your `$PATH`, it'll
Just WorkÂ®).

```bash
$ ubi --project mfontani/ansi2html --in "$HOME/bin"
$ printf '\e[31mred!\e[0m\n' | ansi2html
```

## Usage

```bash
ansi2html < input.txt > output.html
```

Or, if you'd like to strip ANSI color codes instead:

```bash
ansi2html --strip < input.txt > output.txt
```

See `ansi2html --help` for more options. Options' order matters.

You can choose a number of different palettes, which can be given as a parameter to the program. List the available ones with `ansi2html --list-palettes`. The default palette is `vga`.

To get a nice preview of some/all the palettes, you might want to run something like:

```bash
ansi2html --list-palettes | \
    grep -e kanaga -e dracula | \
    xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo ; printf "%s\n" "{}" ; ansi2html --palette {} --rgb-for bg 000000 --showcase-palette'
```

You can further customize the palette (i.e. pick a palette, then customize a few colors; or use the default `vga` palette, and customize _all_ the colors) using the `--rgb-for <0-16,fg,bg> RRGGBB` option (e.g. `--rgb-for 0 101010` to customize the color 0 to be a dark black, or `--rgb-for fg 406040` to make the default foreground text a dark green).
Note that only the first sixteen colors (dark 0-7 and bright 8-15), the default foreground, and the default background colors can be customized. The rest of the 256 colors (16-255) or indeed the 24-bit colors cannot be customized.

You can optionally enable the "bold is bright" feature with `--bold-is-bright` (or `-b`), which will make bold text for the first 7 base colors (i.e. for `\e[0;1;30m` through `\e[0;1;37m`) appear as bright text (i.e. `\e[0;90m` through `\e[0;97m`), as if the brighter colors were used for the foreground). This feature is disabled by default.

The markup outputted can be wrapped in a `pre` tag, by using the `--pre` option. If used, it will contain a `style` attribute, containing the default foreground and background colors' specification for the palette. If you wish to change those, use the `--rgb-for` option. If you need to add more styles to the pre tag, you can use the `--pre-add-style` option (i.e. `--pre-add-style 'padding:0.5em;'`).

You can use the `--palette NAME --show-rgb-for <0-16,fg,bg>` option to show the RGB color for the given 0-16, foreground or background color. Or `--palette NAME --showcase-palette` to see the entire (foreground, background, and base 16 colors for a) palette.

By default, the program uses _in-line style attributes_ for the colors. If you want to use CSS classes instead, use the `--use-classes` option. You can output the CSS contents that should go in the `style` tag with the `--show-style-tag` option. Note that 24-bit colors will always use in-line style attributes, even if `--use-classes` is used.

Example using classes:

```bash
(
    printf '<!DOCTYPE html><head><title>...</title>\n';
    printf '<style>\n';
    ansi2html --palette vga --show-style-tag;
    printf '\n/* Additional styles... */\n';
    printf '</style>\n';
    printf '</head><body><!-- additional markup -->\n';
    ansi2html --palette vga --use-classes --pre < input.txt
    printf '<!-- more markup -->\n';
    printf '</body></html>\n';
) > output.html
```

## How to compile (user)

You can likely get away with something like this:

```bash
env NO_ASAN=1 make ansi2html
env NO_ASAN=1 make CC=clang ansi2html
```

For the `-S` option (strip ANSI codes), on x86_64 an AVX2 or SSE2 version is available when compiled with `-march=native`.
To pick a specific implementation (which can only be compiled if possible), pass on `-DWANT_SSE2` or `-DWANT_AVX2` in `CC=` or `DEFINES`.
Alternatively, use `-DWANT_DEFAULT` to use the default implementation (i.e. without any forced intrinsics).

## How to compile (developer)

Run `make CC=gcc-14 all`. It'll:

- format the code (you'll need `clang-format` installed)
- create the tags file (you'll need `ctags` installed)
- compile the program with `gcc-14` and with ASAN enabled

Else, use the `CC` variable to specify the compiler you want to use, the `NO_ASAN=1` variable to disable Address Sanitizer, and the `ansi2html` target if you just want the executable.
